## Introduction
Inspired by John Cage’s Water Walk, “The Ping Pong Machine” is a web-based project exploring the harmony  in interesting sounds in our mundane life that we often ignore or regard as “noises“, say Ping Pong sounds. 
You can play with the sampled Ping Pong sounds within the frame of a sequencer or trigger the sounds while listening to the arranged one-minute beats by me.
